This is a `Django` application to add `django-crispy-forms` layout objects for [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). It is a fork of [crispy-forms-bulma](https://github.com/jhotujec/crispy-forms-bulma), with the intention of adding support for Django 2.0+, as well as for components found in the bulma-extensions library.

### Installation
Clone it from github. Installation via `pip` coming soon!

Add package settings to your project settings file
